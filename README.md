# jface-swt

An attempt to get a jface/swt application up and running using pure clojure/lein for the running/building
and trying to get it going in the repl
it falls over with DataBinding, it's not simple enough to get a javabean with PropertyChange support, too much code needed
could be a macro I suppose
it's all a bit easier in groovy
did however get the dependencies going with leiningen, seemed to have to use old versions of the eclipse jars from maven central or it would crash leiningen
